            <p>During your engagement shoot or portrait session I will assist and direct you through posing and
                expression to get you and your fiancée / partner comfortable in front of the camera so we can
                incorporate both posed and natural moments on your special day. </p>
            <p>From a fashion forward shoot to a more reserved traditional style, I am here for you.</p>
            <p>I love trying creative things in a fast paced environment. I adapt to any given situation and try to
                bring the beauty out that is already there. This is your day, lets have fun with it and make memories.
            </p>
            <p>I have won a boatload of awards for my work, and I’m grateful for every single one of them, but I’ve
                always been unsure of whether I earned them or whether the jury was rigged. By now I am literally
                addicted to making photos…for which there is no known cure, except to make more.</p>
